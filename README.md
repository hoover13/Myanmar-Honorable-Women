# 01 Overview

Myanmar Honorable Women app serves as a digital repository of empowering stories, highlighting the achievements and contributions of Myanmar women who have left an indelible mark on society. This is the app which brings history to life one scan at a time. This app is elegantly designed with SwiftUI. The main feature of this app is its integration of Augmented Reality technology, powered by Apple’s ARKit. 


By tapping the "View In AR" button, the app activates the device's camera, overlaying the woman's face onto the physical world in real-time. The magic unfolds when users scan a 1000 Myanmar Kyat or 1 US dollar bill using the camera. As the currency comes into view, the woman's face materializes in augmented reality, bridging the gap between past and present, and bringing history to life in a profoundly engaging manner.
